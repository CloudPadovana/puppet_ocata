# puppet_ocata
puppet classes for openstack ocata cloud (controller and compute configuration)

All the sensible data are removed.
Precisely all the passwords, hosts, ip addresses and keys are removed from /controller_ocata/manifests/params.pp, /compute_ocata/manifests/params.pp and also in files located in /controller_ocata/files and /compute_ocata/files
